## About CodeWars
[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online platform that offers a wide range of coding challenges and kata, 
ranging from beginner to advanced levels. It's a great place to practice and improve your JavaScript skills.

## Challenges
I have compiled all the challenges I have completed on CodeWars into subdirectories of programming languages I used to
complete the challenges.
Each challenge typically has a dedicated folder containing both the solution file and a markdown document detailing the 
challenge.
