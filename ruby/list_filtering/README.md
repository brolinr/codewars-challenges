## Descending order challenge
In this kata you I created a function that took a list of non-negative integers
and strings and returned a new list with the strings filtered out.

## Desired Results/Examples:

filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]
